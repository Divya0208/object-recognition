# object_recognition

Object detection application made using TensorFlow lite models - yolov2 and ssd_mobilenet found over the internet to understand the working of flutter and tflite models together. This model was able to detect very general objects with fair accuracy according to the training of that model. The following needs were understood by the development of this application -
  - If TensorFlow is being used to develop the object detection model, a trained model in .tflite format is needed for the development.  
  - A .txt format file containing all the names for the objects to be detected is needed is the tflite model reads names from the folder.
  - The input and output formals of the models are needed to be understood to develop the UI functions.
